Whilst thinking about the scalability of SVGs, I wondered if it would be possible to create an interesting reveal effect by zooming in on a small cut-out region that wasn't previously visible. 

In theory, if you zoom out far enough, the cut-out region would be less than one pixel, making it more or less unnoticeable, if not completely invisible to the viewer.  

Turns out the effect works quite well, but unfortunately not on every OS/Browser combo, so you mileage may vary.
If you want to check out the examples, the latest version of Chrome should work fine.

```
function thisGuy() {
  this.stuff = done;
}

```
